# A Molecular Dynamics study of PIM<sub>2</sub> lipid bilayer membranes
## Files for using the PIM<sub>2</sub> in a Molecular Dynamics
Folders DPPC and PIM2 contains the itp and gro files needed for running a Molecular Dynamics with the respective membranes. DPPC is already configured as a bilayer and was obtained from :question::question::question: PIM2 is one unit of the lipidic molecule.
