# A Molecular Dynamics study of PIM<sub>2</sub> lipid bilayer membranes
## Files for using the PIM<sub>2</sub> in a Molecular Dynamics simulation
* PIM2 
  * This folder has all the files related to   PIM<sub>2</sub> and a bylayer formed by 128 PIM<sub>2</sub> molecules.
* PIM2_tap
  * The folder has the files for the simulation of PIM<sub>2</sub> together with Tap protein inside PIM<sub>2</sub> bilayer.
* DPPC
  *  DPPC is configured as a bilayer as explained in [gromacs tutorial](https://www.gromacs.org/@api/deki/files/206/=membrane_tutorial_online.pdf) and is ready to receive the Tap protein.
